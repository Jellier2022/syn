The in silico evaluation scripts include extraction and organization of the 100-bp flanking sequences upstream and downstream of each variant site. When web-based prediction tools were used, these sequences served as input, and the analyses were performed according to the instructions provided by each website; those steps are not recorded within the scripts. 

The clinical analysis folder contains the original code used for the statistical analyses in this study.
